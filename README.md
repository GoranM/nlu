A Python utilities package for the Blender Game Engine.

---------------------------------------------------------------

For the most part, this is/was an attempt to wrap the BGE API with something a little more convenient/rational. There is a platformer demo in the examples directory (the one from the protoblend video) which shows how it could be used.

Beyond that, there is no documentation, because I'm making this available to fulfill a request, not because I planned a release.
